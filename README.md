# CS50x
This repository will eventually contain all my work from the CS50 online course through Harvard edX. 

CS50 (Computer Science 50) is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science from Harvard. The course material is available for free on HarvadX with a range of certificates available for a fee. Other courses on HarvardX can be found here: https://www.edx.org/school/harvardx

## Syllabus

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience.
