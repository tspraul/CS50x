# Hello, world
Should not need much explanation. :)

# Mario
Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend right-aligned pyramid of blocks. This program recreates that pyramid in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramid itself is also be taller than it is wide.

# Cash
This program first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made with US money.
