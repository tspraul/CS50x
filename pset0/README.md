The assignment was to implement in Scratch any project of my choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:
- Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
- Your project must use at least one sound.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short). As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
